# OpenMind2
A chatroom application for ALX porfolio project

## Introduction
OpenMind at its core is a chatroom application. Users can join or create spaces and have 
conversations in groups.

Initially the project was envisioned as a platform where other members of the ALX software
engineering program would be able to share thoughts and ideas on daily coding assignments or
give tips on these tasks. However, the scope has broadened to include all types of users (ALX
student or not). Regardless, the primary goal still remains the same - sharing thoughs, ideas
and engaging in productive conversations. A problem shared is a problem solved.
